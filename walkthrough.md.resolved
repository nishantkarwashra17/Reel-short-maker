# Walkthrough: AI Reel Short Maker

I have successfully built a complete AI-powered pipeline to transform YouTube videos into high-engagement Reels/Shorts.

## ✨ Features Implemented
- **One-Click Conversion**: Just paste a URL and get viral clips.
- **AI Viral Clipping**: Uses Gemini AI to intelligently pick the best moments.
- **Dynamic 9:16 Reframing**: MediaPipe face-tracking keeps the speaker centered.
- **Professional Captions**: Trending yellow/white font with drop shadows and black strokes.
- **No Watermarks**: Native video processing using FFmpeg/MoviePy.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **AI**: Gemini 1.5 Flash (Analysis), Faster-Whisper (Transcription).
- **Video**: MoviePy, MediaPipe, OpenCV, yt-dlp.
- **UI**: Streamlit.

## 🎬 Final Product Structure
All source files are available in the project directory:
- [app.py](file:///c:/Users/gomti/reel%20short%20maker/app.py) - Main UI & Launcher
